broad-backed hippopotamus\\r\\n     Rests on his belly in the mud;\\r\\n     Although he seems so firm to us\\r\\n     He is merely flesh and blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Flesh-and-blood is weak and frail,\\r\\n     Susceptible to nervous shock;\\r\\n     While the True Church can never fail\\r\\n     For it is based upon a rock.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The hippo\\'s feeble steps may err\\r\\n     In compassing material ends,\\r\\n     While the True Church need never stir\\r\\n     To gather in its dividends.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The \\'potamus can never reach\\r\\n     The mango on the mango-tree;\\r\\n     But fruits of pomegranate and peach\\r\\n     Refresh the Church from over sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n     At mating time the hippo\\'s voice\\r\\n     Betrays inflexions hoarse and odd,\\r\\n     But every week we hear rejoice\\r\\n     The Church, at being one with God.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The hippopotamus\\'s day\\r\\n     Is passed in sleep; at night he hunts;\\r\\n     God works in a mysterious way-\\r\\n     The Church can sleep and feed at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n     I saw the \\'potamus take wing\\r\\n     Ascending from the damp savannas,\\r\\n     And quiring angels round him sing\\r\\n     The praise of God, in loud hosannas.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Blood of the Lamb shall wash him clean\\r\\n     And him shall heavenly arms enfold,\\r\\n     Among the saints he shall be seen\\r\\n     Performing on a harp of gold.\\r\\n\\r\\n     He shall be washed as white as snow,\\r\\n     By all the martyr\\'d virgins kiss,\\r\\n     While the True Church remains below\\r\\n

middle of my hair--\\r\\n     (They will say: \"How his hair is growing thin!\")\\r\\n     My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\\r\\n     My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by

 Then how should I begin\\r\\n     To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?\\r\\n       And how should I presume?\\r\\n\\r\\n     And I have known the arms already, known them all--\\r\\n     Arms that are braceleted and white and bare\\r\\n     (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)\\r\\n     Is it perfume from a dress\\r\\n     That makes me so digress?\\r\\n     Arms

ices,\\r\\n     Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\\r\\n     But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,\\r\\n     Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,\\r\\n     I am no prophet--and here\\'s no great matter;\\r\\n     I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\\r\\n     And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\\r\\n     And in short, I was afraid.\\r\\n\\r\\n     And would it have been worth it, after all,\\r\\n     After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\\r\\n     Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,\\r\\n     Would it have been worth while,\\r\\n     To have bitten off the matter with a smile,\\r\\n     To have squeezed the universe into a ball\\r\\n     To roll it toward some

After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,\\r\\n     After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the\\r\\n         floor--\\r\\n     And this, and so much more?--\\r\\n     It is impossible to say just what I mean!\\r\\n     But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:\\r\\n     Would it have been worth while\\r\\n     If

 And the light crept up between the shutters,\\r\\n     And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,\\r\\n     You had such a vision of the street\\r\\n     As the street hardly understands;\\r\\n     Sitting along the bed\\'s edge, where\\r\\n     You curled the papers from your hair,\\r\\n     Or clasped the yellow soles of feet\\r\\n     In the palms of both soiled hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n     IV\\r\\n\\r\\n     His soul stretched tight across the skies\\r\\n     That fade behind a city block,\\r\\n     Or trampled by insistent feet\\r\\n     At four and five and six o\\'clock;\\r\\n     And short square fingers stuffing pipes,\\r\\n     And evening newspapers, and eyes\\r\\n     Assured of certain certainties,\\r\\n     The conscience of a blackened street\\r\\n     Impatient to assume the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n     I am moved by fancies that are curled\\r\\n     Around these images, and cling:\\r\\n     The notion of some infinitely gentle\\r\\n     Infinitely suffering thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;\\r\\n     The worlds revolve like ancient women\\r\\n     Gathering fuel in vacant lots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRhapsody on a

memory\\r\\n     And all its clear relations,\\r\\n     Its divisions and precisions,\\r\\n     Every street lamp that I pass\\r\\n     Beats like a fatalistic drum,\\r\\n     And through the spaces of the dark\\r\\n     Midnight shakes the memory\\r\\n     As a madman shakes a dead geranium.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Half-past one,\\r\\n     The street lamp sputtered,\\r\\n     The street lamp muttered,\\r\\n     The street lamp said,\\r\\n     \"Regard that woman\\r\\n     Who hesitates toward you in the light of the door\\r\\n     Which opens on her like a grin.\\r\\n     You see the border of her dress\\r\\n     Is torn and stained with sand,\\r\\n     And you see the corner of her eye\\r\\n     Twists like a crooked pin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     The memory throws up high and dry\\r\\n     A crowd of twisted things;\\r\\n     A twisted branch upon the beach\\r\\n     Eaten smooth, and polished\\r\\n     As if the world gave up\\r\\n     The secret of its skeleton,\\r\\n     Stiff and white.\\r\\n     A broken spring in a factory yard,\\r\\n     Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left\\r\\n     Hard and curled and ready to snap.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Half-past two,\\r\\n     The street-lamp said,\\r\\n     \"Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,\\r\\n     Slips out its tongue\\r\\n     And devours a morsel of rancid butter.\"\\r\\n     So the hand of the child, automatic,\\r\\n     Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along\\r\\n     the quay.\\r\\n     I could see nothing behind that child\\'s eye.\\r\\n     I have seen eyes in the street\\r\\n     Trying to peer through lighted shutters,\\r\\n     And a crab one afternoon in a pool,\\r\\n     An old crab with barnacles on his back,\\r\\n     Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Half-past three,\\r\\n     The lamp sputtered,\\r\\n     The lamp muttered in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The lamp hummed:\\r\\n     \"Regard the moon,\\r\\n     La lune ne garde aucune rancune,\\r\\n     She winks a feeble eye,\\r\\n     She smiles into corners.\\r\\n     She smooths the hair of the grass.\\r\\n     The moon has lost her memory.\\r\\n     A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,\\r\\n     Her hand twists a paper rose,\\r\\n     That smells of dust and old Cologne,\\r\\n     She is alone With all the old nocturnal smells\\r\\n     That cross and cross across her brain.\\r\\n     The reminiscence comes\\r\\n     Of sunless dry geraniums\\r\\n     And dust in crevices,\\r\\n     Smells of chestnuts in the streets\\r\\n     And female smells in shuttered rooms\\r\\n     And cigarettes in corridors\\r\\n     And cocktail smells in bars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     The lamp said,\\r\\n     \"Four o\\'clock,\\r\\n     Here is the number on the door.\\r\\n     Memory!\\r\\n     You have the key,\\r\\n     The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,\\r\\n     Mount.\\r\\n     The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,\\r\\n     Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     The last twist of the knife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMorning at the Window\\r\\n\\r\\n     They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens,\\r\\n     And along the trampled edges of the street\\r\\n     I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids\\r\\n     Sprouting despondently at area gates.\\r\\n     The brown waves of fog toss up to me\\r\\n     Twisted faces from the bottom of the street,\\r\\n     And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts\\r\\n     An aimless smile that hovers in the air\\r\\n     And vanishes along the level of the roofs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boston Evening Transcript\\r\\n\\r\\n     The readers of the Boston Evening Transcript\\r\\n     Sway in the wind like a field of ripe corn.\\r\\n     When evening quickens faintly in the street,\\r\\n     Wakening the appetites of life in some\\r\\n     And to others bringing the Boston Evening Transcript,\\r\\n     I mount the steps and ring the bell, turning\\r\\n     Wearily, as one would turn to nod good-bye to Rochefoucauld,\\r\\n     If the street were time and he at the end of the street,\\r\\n     And I say, \"Cousin Harriet, here is the Boston Evening Transcript.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAunt Helen\\r\\n\\r\\n     Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt,\\r\\n     And lived in a small house near a fashionable square\\r\\n     Cared for by servants to the number of four.\\r\\n     Now when she died there was silence in heaven\\r\\n     And silence at her end of the street.\\r\\n     The shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet--\\r\\n     He was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before.\\r\\n     The dogs were handsomely provided for,\\r\\n     But shortly afterwards the parrot died too.\\r\\n     The Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece,\\r\\n     And the footman sat upon the dining-table\\r\\n     Holding the second housemaid on his knees--\\r\\n     Who had always been so careful while her mistress lived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCousin Nancy\\r\\n\\r\\n     Miss Nancy Ellicott Strode across the hills and broke them,\\r\\n     Rode across the hills and broke them--\\r\\n     The barren New England hills--\\r\\n     Riding to hounds\\r\\n     Over the cow-pasture.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Miss Nancy Ellicott smoked\\r\\n     And danced all the modern dances;\\r\\n     And her aunts were not quite sure how they felt about it,\\r\\n     But they knew that it was modern.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Upon the glazen shelves kept watch\\r\\n     Matthew and Waldo, guardians of the faith,\\r\\n     The army of unalterable law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Apollinax\\r\\n\\r\\n     When Mr. Apollinax visited the United States\\r\\n     His laughter tinkled among the teacups.\\r\\n     I thought of Fragilion, that shy figure among the birch-trees,\\r\\n     And of Priapus in the shrubbery\\r\\n     Gaping at the lady in the swing.\\r\\n     In the palace of Mrs. Phlaccus, at Professor Channing-Cheetah\\'s\\r\\n     He laughed like an irresponsible foetus.\\r\\n     HWith your aid indiffeis laughter was submarine and profound\\r\\n     Like the old man of the sea\\'s\\r\\n     Hidden under coral islands\\r\\n     Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence,\\r\\n     Dropping from fingers of surf.\\r\\n     I looked for the head of Mr. Apollinax rolling under a chair\\r\\n     Or grinning over a screen\\r\\n     With seaweed in its hair.\\r\\n     I heard the beat of centaur\\'s hoofs over the hard turf\\r\\n     As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon.\\r\\n     \"He is a charming man\"--\"But after all what did he mean?\"--\\r\\n     \"His pointed ears... He must be unbalanced,\"--\\r\\n     \"There was something he said that I might have challenged.\"\\r\\n     Of dowager Mrs. Phlaccus, and Professor and Mrs. Cheetah\\r\\n     I remember a slice of lemon, and a bitten macaroon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHysteria\\r\\n\\r\\n     As she laughed I was aware of becoming involved in her\\r\\n     laughter and being part of it, until her teeth were\\r\\n     only accidental stars with a talent for squad-drill. I\\r\\n     was drawn in by short gasps, inhaled at each momentary\\r\\n     recovery, lost finally in the dark caverns of her\\r\\n     throat, bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles. An\\r\\n     elderly waiter with trembling hands was hurriedly\\r\\n     spreading a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty\\r\\n     green iron table, saying: \"If the lady and gentleman\\r\\n     wish to take their tea in the garden, if the lady and\\r\\n     gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden...\" I\\r\\n     decided that if the shaking of her breasts could be\\r\\n     stopped, some of the fragments of the afternoon might\\r\\n     be collected, and I concentrated my attention with\\r\\n     careful subtlety to this end.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConversation Galante\\r\\n\\r\\n     I observe: \"Our sentimental friend the moon!\\r\\n     Or possibly (fantastic, I confess)\\r\\n     It may be Prester John\\'s balloon\\r\\n     Or an old battered lantern hung aloft\\r\\n     To light poor travellers to their distress.\"\\r\\n       She then: \"How you digress!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     And I then: \"Some one frames upon the keys\\r\\n     That exquisite nocturne, with which we explain\\r\\n     The night and moonshine; music which we seize\\r\\n     To body forth our vacuity.\"\\r\\n       She then: \"Does this refer to me?\"\\r\\n       \"Oh no, it is I who am inane.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"You, madam, are the eternal humorist,\\r\\n     The eternal enemy of the absolute,\\r\\n     Giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist!\\r\\n     With your air indifferent and imperious\\r\\n     At a stroke our mad poetics to confute--\"\\r\\n       And--\"Are we then so serious?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLa Figlia Che Piange\\r\\n\\r\\n       O quam te memorem Virgo...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Stand on the highest pavement of the stair--\\r\\n     Lean on a garden urn--\\r\\n     Weave, weave the sunlight in your hair--\\r\\n     Clasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise--\\r\\n     Fling them to the ground and turn\\r\\n     With a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\\r\\n     But weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n     So I would have had him leave,\\r\\n     So I would have had her stand and grieve,\\r\\n     So he would have left\\r\\n     As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\\r\\n     As the mind deserts the body it has used.\\r\\n     I should find\\r\\n     Some way incomparably light and deft,\\r\\n     Some way we both should understand,\\r\\n     Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n     She turned away, but with the autumn weather\\r\\n     Compelled my imagination many days,\\r\\n     Many days and many hours:\\r\\n     Her hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\\r\\n     And I wonder how they should have been together!\\r\\n     I should have lost a gesture and a pose.\\r\\n     Sometimes these cogitations still amaze\\r\\n     The troubled midnight and the noon\\'s repose.'"
